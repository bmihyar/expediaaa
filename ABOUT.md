I have decided to use Node.js because Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime V8 for easily building fast, scalable network applications. 
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
For server side REST APIs calling, Node.js from my experience always recommended.

So when i have received this assignment, immediately Node.js came to my mind, but as its required to build simple website, i started to think about template engine, and decided to use EJS as i have an old experience in it.
Its required to build the App and run it on Heroku, this is something new to me, but i was happy about this requirement, i wanted to try it, and now its the time, so thank you Expedia team for this request.
I have started to look at Heroku, as its an area i don't have experience in before, went through their documentations, and i found Node.js sample App, that helpd me alot, and make it simple for me.
I actually depended on Heroku sample Node.js App and build over it ... i found it easy although i didn't get into it deeply.

Before start working on this assignment, i have breaked the work on the following steps:
1. Get into Heroku, and understand how i can putt my App onit.
2. Test and run the API: I did Native testing the browser to see the results, and then i have used Mocha, and Chai to test the API
3. Did some refreshment on EJS and how to pass data
4. Decided to do native call to the APIs on Node.js App, through (https) package, then decided to use (request) package to make the code simpler.
